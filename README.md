# Real-Time Hand Gesture Control using Mediapipe + Deep Learning

This project uses Mediapipe to detect hand landmarks and a custom-trained deep learning model to classify gestures in real-time using webcam; gestures to perform tasks on the computer without touching the keyboard or mouse, such as maximising,minimising, scroll upwards or downwards.

## Supported Gestures

Gesture |  Action

`up`    |   Scroll up 
`down`  |   Scroll down 
`max`   |   Maximize current window 
`min`   |   Minimize current window 
`none`  |   No action (when no hand is detected)
